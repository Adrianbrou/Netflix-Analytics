I recently completed an end-to-end data analytics project analyzing Netflix’s content performance and customer viewing behavior using Power BI and Excel.

The project focused on cleaning, transforming, and visualizing Netflix content and customer data to uncover actionable business insights around user engagement, subscription trends, and content strategy. Key analyses included identifying the most-watched movies and TV shows, understanding how subscription types impact watch time, analyzing customer demographics and viewing preferences, and evaluating how content ratings, genres, and release timing influence engagement across different countries.

I designed an interactive Power BI dashboard with slicers and drill-downs to explore customer behavior, genre popularity by region, subscription market share, and retention patterns. The final outcome included data-driven recommendations to support Netflix’s content localization, release planning, and subscription strategy decisions.
